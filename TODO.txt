Virtual devices somehow give "Unknown OPAL SSC" as well as "Invalid or unsupported device"
Container devices and nonexistent devices just give out nothing.
Those are w.r.t. --query.  --scan looks pretty clean.

Big TODO is to lift common Drive code to Common, leaving only a very OS-specific subclass in e.g. linux.
I.e.  where I now have DtaDevMacOSScsiDrive in ./linux,
      I would instead have DtaDevScsiDrive in ./Common that would handle e.g. all the Page80 stuff and
                           DtaDevMacOSScsiDrive in ./linux would just handle PerformSCSICommand (and perhaps __identify)
